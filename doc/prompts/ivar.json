Doubledots uses attributes in HTML elements to react to events. Doubledots works by adding reactionchains as attributes to html elements. Each reactionchain is broken into two or more pieces separated by ':'. 

## triggers: and :reaction:chains

The first part of the reaction chain is the trigger. The trigger represents the event and is named after the the type of native events `click` or `focus` and other triggers such as type such as `hover` or `inview` or `attribute-changed`. 

, followed by chaining reactions that are separated with ' : '. When we describe triggers in explanation text, we use `trigger-name:` as shorthand.

After the trigger a series of reactions follow. Each reaction is a function that will run when the trigger: is activated. The reactions have different names, such as 'check-validity' or 'toggle-css-class'. The shorthand for referencing a reaction is adding a prefix ':' infront of the name such as ':check-validity'.

For each trigger: several :reactions can be added sequentially. An example of this is: 'click:checkIfOk:extractData:updateValue' where: 

1. The `click` is a trigger
2. The `checkIfOk` is a filter reaction that validates the input
3. The `extractData` is a extractor reaction that retrieves data from the DOM or someplace else
4. The `updateValue` is an effect reaction that changes/mutates the value in the DOM

## How do reaction chains function? 

First, an event or timer or similar activates the trigger:. The trigger calls the first reaction and passes it the event. The first reaction runs, and passes its result to the second. Which then run and pass its result to the third reaction.

Each reaction is defined as a JS function that takes two arguments: `(e , oi)`. The `e` is the event, and the `oi` is the Output from the previous reaction that becomes the Input for this reaction.

```js
customReaction.define('checkIfOk', function(e, oi){
  // Perform validation and return
});
```

## Categories of reactions

- trigger: (click, in-view)
- filter (read => to break):
- extraction (read => to oi output):
- effect (write => DOM):
- side-effect (write => outside of DOM):
- schedulers (throttle, debounce, setTimeout, ready)
- pure reaction (pure, immutable functions that uses the `e` or the `oi` to form a new `oi` without mutating the incoming `e` or `oi`).



Make me an example for how we can make a calculator using this system? Break the example into the following three parts.
1. Layout the html needed for the example. Use minimal template, no css, and no JS.
2. add functionality using only doubledots triggers and reactions in the html example.
3. Explain the functionality of the triggers and reactions in plain english.
4. Describe the roles the different reactions play, such as trigger, filter, extractor, mutator, effect, side-effect, schedular, pure reaction.

# Demo: How to build a calculator 

In this example we implement doubledots on a classic calculator. We start with a simple normal html template without any css or js code attached.

## 1. Template first

```html

only the calculator, link to the css, table, no custom reaction nor script

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Simple Calculator</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='./calc.css' type='text/css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <table id='calculator'>
      <tr>
        <td id='result'></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id='operation'></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id='input'></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='operator'>C</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='number'>1</td>
        <td class='number'>2</td>
        <td class='number'>3</td>
        <td class='operator'>/</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='number'>4</td>
        <td class='number'>5</td>
        <td class='number'>6</td>
        <td class='operator'>*</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='number'>7</td>
        <td class='number'>8</td>
        <td class='number'>9</td>
        <td class='operator'>-</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='number'>0</td>
        <td class='number'>.</td>
        <td class='operator'>=</td>
        <td class='operator'>+</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Add first reaction

The first reaciton is to add numbers to the input, when we click on a button inside the calculator. First, we do this by adding a the custom reaction `click:add_number` to the container parent that is the closest ancestor to all the elements involved.

```html
<table id='calculator' click:add_number>
  . . .
</table>
<script>
  customReactions.define('add_number', function (e, i) {
    const input = this.ownerElement.querySelector('#input');
    input.innerText += i;
  });
</script>
```

Problems: the reaction doesn't have a check. if you click something other than a number, we have errors.
## 3. add filter

How to fix this? we add a filter in the chain `click:is_number:add_number`

```html
<table id='calculator' click:add_number>
  . . .
</table>
<script>
  customReactions.define('is_number', function (e) {
    if (['result', 'operation', 'input'].indexOf(e.target.id) >= 0) throw customReactions.break;
    if (e.target.innerText.matches(/0-9/)) return e.target.innerText;
    throw customReactions.break;
  });
  customReactions.define('add_number', function (e, i) {
    const input = this.ownerElement.querySelector('#input');
    input.innerText += i;
  });
</script>
```
## 4. add the operator function

Let's build the entire calculator. Here we need to explain the logic with the previous operator and the hidden result etc. Once the strategy is explained, just add the extra custom reaction definitions, and the custom reaction invocations on the `<table>` element.

```html
<table id='calculator' _keypress:is_number:add_number>
  . . .
</table>
<script>
  customReactions.define('is_operator', function (e) {
    if (['result', 'operation', 'input'].indexOf(e.target.id) >= 0) throw customReactions.break;
    if (e.type === 'keypress') {
      if (e.key === 'Esc') return 'clear';
      if (['=', '+', '-', '/', '*'].indexOf(e.key) >= 0) return e.key;
    }
    if (e.type === 'click') {
      const targetTxt = e.target.innerText;
      if (['=', '+', '-', '/', '*', 'clear'].indexOf(targetTxt) >= 0) return targetTxt;
    }
    throw customReactions.break;
  });
  customReactions.define('do_operator', function (e, i) {
    . . . (calculator logic) . . .
  });
</script>
```

## 5. add the keypress functionality

With a calculator you want multiple events. Add reactions for keypress too.

```html
<table id='calculator' _keypress:is_number:add_number>
  . . .
</table>
<script>
  customReactions.define('is_number', function (e) {
    if (['result', 'operation', 'input'].indexOf(e.target.id) >= 0) throw customReactions.break;
    if (e.type === 'keypress' && e.key.matches(/0-9/)) return e.key;
    if (e.type === 'click' && e.target.innerText.matches(/0-9/)) return e.target.innerText;
    throw customReactions.break;
  });
  customReactions.define('add_number', function (e, i) {
    const input = this.ownerElement.querySelector('#input');
    input.innerText += i;
  });
</script>
```

# Demo: Shoppingcart

How to build a shopping cart using Doubledots? Easy! Set up the html template a shoppingcart, add the custom reactions you need, and then define them. This demo shows how you can extract data from the dom, and then use this data to add elements to the DOM. And how you can use Doubledots in your moneymaking schemes.

## 1. HTML Template

First, we start with a simple HTML layout. This template includes a list of products and a cart where items will be listed as they are added.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Shopping Cart Example</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='./style.css' type='text/css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id='products'>
      <div class='product' data-id='1'>
        Product 1 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <div class='product' data-id='2'>
        Product 2 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <!-- Add more products as needed -->
    </div>
    <div id='cart'>
      <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
      <div id='cart-items'></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that we have a button for each item, but that the `data-id` are attached to a different element.

## 2. Adding our first trigger:reaction

Next, we incorporate our initial custom reaction: `click:add_to_cart`. To find out where to place it, we try to find a balance between the following requirements:
1. *as close as possible* to the `target` of the `trigger:` event,
2. *as close as possible* to any element that we need to either extract data from or mutate, and
3. encompasses as many different trigger events as possible.


In the template above, that is the `<div id='products' click:add_to_cart>`. This element is:
1. the grandparent of the `<button>` target node (not super close, but ok),
2. The parent of the `<div class='product'..>` elements that we need to extract the `data-id` attribute value from (parent node is close), and
3. this grandparent will capture all the `click` events from all the `<button class='add-to-cart'>` elements (many-events => one-trigger, nice).

```html
  <body>
    <div id='products' click:add_to_cart>
      <div class='product' data-id='1'>
        Product 1 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <div class='product' data-id='2'>
        Product 2 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
```

Balance struck!

## 3. Analyzing the reaction chain

The custom reactions usually perform many functions. When we first start analyzing a reaction, there are three different functions we look for:

1. :filter. Do we need to ensure that the trigger we are receiving is *meant for* this reaction? This is especially true when we place the trigger on an ancestor of the `target` element of an event, such as in this case.

2. :extractor. What data does the custom reaction need? In this example, we need to find the `data-id` near the button pressed.

3. :transformer. Do we need to transform the data in any way before we do something with it? Here is your chance to make those excellent *puuuuure* functions.

4. :effect or :side-effect. We likely want the reaction to do something with the data extracted. What and where?

In this example, we need to:
1. filter the `click` event so as to only accept `click`s on `<button class='add-to-cart'>` elements. => `:is-add-button`

2. extract data from that button `target` => `:get-data-id`

3. make the template for the product in the shopping cart => `:make-cart-product`

4. add this product(id) to the cart => `:add-to-cart`

```html
  <body>
    <div id='products' click:is-add-button:get-data-id:make-cart-product:add-to-cart>
      <div class='product' data-id='1'>
        Product 1 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <div class='product' data-id='2'>
        Product 2 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
```

## 4. Defining the reaction

The last step is to define the reactions.

```js
// check if target is `button.add-to-cart`
customReactions.define('is-add-button', function (e) {
  if(!(e.target.matches('button.add-to-cart')))
    return customReactions.break;
});
// get data-id
customReactions.define('get-data-id', function (e) {
  return e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-id');
});
// make the template to put in the shopping cart
customReactions.define('make-cart-product', function (e, oi) {
  return `<cart-product data-id='${oi}'>Product #${oi}</cart-product>`;
});
// add to cart
customReactions.define('add-to-cart', function (e, oi) {
  this.nextSiblingElement.insertAdjacentHtml('before-end', oi);
});
```

## 5. shopping cart symposium

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Shopping Cart Example</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='./style.css' type='text/css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id='products'>
      <div class='product' data-id='1'>
        Product 1 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <div class='product' data-id='2'>
        Product 2 <button class='add-to-cart'>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
      <!-- Add more products as needed -->
    </div>
    <div id='cart'>
      <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
      <div id='cart-items'></div>
    </div>
  </body>
  <script>
    // check if target is `button.add-to-cart`
    customReactions.define('is-add-button', function (e) {
      if(!(e.target.matches('button.add-to-cart')))
        return customReactions.break;
    });
    // get data-id
    customReactions.define('get-data-id', function (e) {
      return e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-id');
    });
    // make the template to put in the shopping cart
    customReactions.define('make-cart-product', function (e, oi) {
      return `<cart-product data-id='${oi}'>Product #${oi}</cart-product>`;
    });
    // add to cart
    customReactions.define('add-to-cart', function (e, oi) {
      this.nextSiblingElement.querySelector('#cart-items'*.insertAdjacentHtml('before-end', oi);
    });
  </script>
</html>
```

1. When a user `click:` on an 'Add to Cart' button within `div#products`, the `click` triggers the reaction chain.
2. First the `:is-add-button` filter ensures that the chain is only reacting to the relevant buttons.
3. Then the `:get-data-id` uses the `target` of the `click` event to find the `data-id` attribute on the correct `div.product` element.
4. Then the `:make-cart-product` processes the `id` to generate the right template we need to update the DOM.
5. And finally, the `:add-to-cart` effect updates the `div#cart-items` to add the item to the cart.

## 6. What did we learn?

- **triggers:** enable us to react to native events.
- **:filters** use the event, the DOM, and other sources to ensure that we are only reacting to relevant events.
- **:extractors** helps us find the data that we need, most often from the DOM or the event.
- **:transformers** can convert the data that we are working on into the form we need.
- **:effects** uses data from the reaction chain to modify the DOM.

  Good example!
  
  Make a short example of a simple dropdown box, that echoes the functionality of `<details>` and `<summary>` tightly.
  "
}, {
  "role": "system",
  "content": "# Demo: `<details open>` vs. `click:hidden`

The native `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements are a good example of recurring problem, being given what feels like a kinda convoluted solution. The problem with the native `<details>` and `<summary>` solution is not that it doesn't work, but:
1. you might want to use your own HTML elements, and not `<details><summary>`,
2. you might need to control the trigger events so as to hide on `doubleclick` or `keypress[h]`,
3. you might wish to hide only a single piece of content, hide everything, trigger the hiding from outside the container element, or
4. something else.

So, in that sense, the main problem with `<details>` and `<summary>` is that the technique solves a subset of all the tightly connected click-to-show-hide usecases.

Doubledots to the rescue!

## 1. HTML Layout

First, we need to create the basic HTML structure. We'll have a container that acts as our dropdown, and within it, a summary element that when clicked, reveals or hides the content.

```html
<div>Thinking ahead</div>
<div id='container'>
  <div class='one'>One</div>
  <div class='two'>Two</div>
  <div class='three'>Three!</div>
</div>
```

## 2. Adding Functionality with Doubledots

Let's add a custom reaction that echo that of `<details><summary>`.

```html
<style>
  :not([open]):not([click:parent-toggle-open]) { display: none; }
</style>
<div>Thinking ahead</div>
<div id='container'>
  <div class='one' click:parent-toggle-open>One</div>
  <div class='two'>Two</div>
  <div class='three'>Three!</div>
</div>
```

A `click` on `div.one` will toggle the attribute `open` on the container element, which in turn will turn on/off the display of all non-first children. Nice. But. There are so many other alternatives too. Let's make some more:

### hide (and unhide) next element

```html
<div click:next-toggle-hidden>Thinking ahead</div>
<div id='container'>
  <div class='one'>One</div>
  <div class='two'>Two</div>
  <div class='three'>Three!</div>
</div>
```

A `click` will toggle the `hidden` attribute on the next element.

### `doubleclick` to show a select few

```html
<style>
  :not([even]) .even { display: none; }
</style>
<div>Thinking ahead</div>
<div id='container' doubleclick:toggle-even>
  <div class='one odd'>One</div>
  <div class='two even'>Two</div>
  <div class='three odd'>Three</div>
  <div class='four even'>Four</div>
  <div class='three odd'>Five!</div>
</div>
```

Here, we use both a different trigger `doubleclick:` that more selectivly shows and hides elements. 

## 3. defining reactions

As there are many alternative use-cases for show-hide-toggles, there are many ways to implement them. Let's make some variants around the first `click:parent-toggle-open` example.

### A simple, all-in-one `:parent-toggle-open`

The first alternative is to just straight ahead implement a single reaction.

```html
...
<div id='container'>
  <div class='one' click:parent-toggle-open>One</div>
  <div class='two'>Two</div>
  ...
</div>
<script>
  customReactions.define('parent-toggle-open', function(){
    this.ownerElement.parentNode.attributes.toggleAttribute('open');
  });
</script>
```

### A dash and a rule

Another alternative is to use the dash rule (`:-xyz`) and add our own `toggle-attr_` rule. Here, we are using two rules that you will find quickly becoming part of your core reaction rule registry. To see more about the `:-` dash rule, see the chapter on it; the `toggle-attr_` rule is implement in the example:

```html
...
<div id='container'>
  <div class='one' click:-p:toggle-attr_open>One</div>
  <div class='two'>Two</div>
  ...
</div>
<script>
  customReactions.defineRule('toggle-attr_', function(name){
    name = name.split('_')[1];
    return function(e, oi){
      this.toggleAttribute(name);
      return oi;
    };
  });
</script>
```

## What `rules` to follow?

There are different ways to code. And different opinions on what makes for the most readable examples. But, regardless of which path you choose, it is useful to learn more about how reaction rules, and especially their use, can create dependencies in your code.

In the example above, the `toggle-attr_` rule is implicitly using an `element` as `this`. When the reaction chain starts, the `this` is the origin attribute, and you *must* at some point *before* the `:toggle-attr_` reaction have another reaction that sets the origin `this` of the reaction chain to an element. Thus, there has to be a previous reaction like the `:-p` that has moved the reaction chain's origin to an element.

This creates a dependency from the `:toggle-attr_` rule to:
* at minimum an 'origin moving reaction style', or
* more likely extensive use of the `:-` dash rule.

So, there is no strong dependency from the `:toggle-attr_` rule to the `:-` rule, but there is a soft dependency."

The demo uses the `hover:` trigger to toggle a css class on the element being hovered to alter the mouse pointer to something else.

The purpose of the demo is to illustrate how triggers are made."
